katapi

Presenting library data from SRU services in friendly ways.

Try it at [katapi.biblionaut.net](//katapi.biblionaut.net/)

Work in progress

- Currently using Laravel4, which is a bit overkill, playing with Phalcon could be fun
- Currently JSON-only, should add more representations and content negotiation 
- Would be interesting to include or link to data from other sources
